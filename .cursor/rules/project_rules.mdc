This is a WordPress theme made with TailPress. It is developed using Vite and Tailwind v4, and then built to produce the WordPress theme files.

Whenever possible, use tailwind to style theme components.

Use the colors defined for the theme to maintain consistency:

-   primary (orange color that appears on some buttons and highlighted text)
-   secondary (secondary blue color that appears on some buttons and text)
-   dark (main site background color, dark blue)
-   light (light color for some components and sections)

Use lucide to render icons.

To display theme images, always load them using the get_theme_image_url() helper so that it works correctly in production.

At the end of the changes, add a summary of what was done to the CHANGELOG.md file, always checking the theme version (based on style.css) and the current date (run a script to obtain the current date). Add what was done below the version and date, for example:

## 0.0.1 - 2025-12-02
